# SquareSolver
That's a programm whitch solve all types of square equation.

How to compile it:
  1. Download repository
  2. Download g++ compiler
  3. Download make for cmd
  4. Open cmd choose folder with project
  5. Then write make
  Now you have .exe file to open programm
 
How to open it in calculating mode:
  1. Open in cmd folder with .exe file
  2. then write in cmd >SQRsolver.exe
  3. You see: 
      Square equation solver
      a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
      Enter coefficents a, b and c divided space:
  4. You should write coefficents, example, this means equation 1*x^2 + 2 * x + 1 = 0:
      1 2 1
  5. Programm writes number of roots and numeric values of roots, example:
      one root: -1
  6. You successfully calculated square equation!

How to open it in test mode:
  1. Open in cmd folder with .exe file
  2. then write in cmd name .exe file and name of file with tests .txt (one is in repository), divided space, example:
      >SQRsolver.exe SquareEquationTestData.txt
  3. You can see log of test, example:
      Square equation solver
      a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
      Test mode:
      Test OK
        ...
      Test OK
      Tests completed 10/10
      End of test
   4. This title means, one of test is wrong, you break program:
      Test error: ...
   5. Now you can test your own program improvements
